This script is designed to process and fill missing ET_obs values in multiple CSV files based on dynamic window calculations and interpolation methods. The script expects CSV files containing a TIMESTAMP column, along with other meteorological variables like NETRAD, G, TA, PA, VPD, and WS. The missing ET_obs values will be filled using surrounding data points within dynamic time windows.
一、Dependencies：Ensure that the required Python libraries pandas, numpy, os, glob, and tqdm are installed. These libraries are used for data manipulation, numerical operations, file handling, and displaying progress bars.
二、Input Files：The script processes CSV files in a folder. Each CSV file should include the following columns:  1.TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of the measurement.  2.ET_obs: Observed evapotranspiration values (may contain missing values).  3.Other meteorological variables: NETRAD, G, TA, PA, VPD, WS.
三、Output Files：  After processing, the script saves the files with the missing ET_obs values filled. The new columns added include:  1.ET_filled: The filled evapotranspiration values.  2.fill_logo: A flag indicating if the value was filled.  3.iteration_count: The number of attempts made to fill the value.
四、Usage Instructions：  1.Set the input_folder_path and output_folder_path to the appropriate directories.  2.Adjust the window_options list to define the dynamic windows used to fill missing values based on neighboring data points.  3.Run the script to process each CSV file in the input folder. 
The script will iteratively fill missing ET_obs values using data from surrounding days, saving the results in the output folder.The script uses an iterative approach to fill missing values, attempting to fill them up to a maximum number of iterations (default is 1000). If a value cannot be filled after the maximum iterations, it will remain NaN. The script applies the defined windowing strategy to calculate the missing values based on neighboring data and meteorological relationships.
